# Recurrent Staphylococcus Infections Dashboard

## **Project Motivation and Sample Description**

This project utilizes a confidential dataset of Staphylococcus infections from electronic health records collected between 2002 and 2019. The dataset is derived from over 20,000 patients at **Childrenâ€™s Healthcare of Atlanta** and focuses on **recurrent Staph infections** across various demographic groups.

The study population includes **20,361 patients** after filtering for community-onset infections and excluding patients younger than 19 years old who reside in Georgia.

### **Dataset Overview**:
- **Infection Count**
- **Demographic Variables**: Age, Sex, Race, Insurance Status
- **Staph Type**: MRSA, MSSA, and Shifting types

## **Research Questions**

1. How does recurrence status vary across different demographic groups?
2. Are certain groups more prone to recurrent infections?
3. How do different Staph types correlate with recurrence?

## **Public Health Relevance**

This dashboard is designed to help healthcare providers identify **high-risk populations** for recurrent Staph infections. By pinpointing these groups, the tool can support the development of targeted healthcare interventions and policies aimed at addressing recurrent infections in pediatric populations.
